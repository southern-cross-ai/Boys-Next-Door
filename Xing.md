# About Me

## Hey there! I'm Xing Chen 🌟

> "Life is a game, and I'm here to level up."

Greetings, traveler of the internet! I'm **Xing Chen**, a gaming enthusiast, basketball lover (though my post-eye-surgery days keep me off the court), and a tech geek navigating the world of computing. 🚀

## 🎮 Gamer by Heart, Coder by Trade

When I'm not immersed in writing code, I'm usually deep in the world of video games. Whether it's the strategic chaos of **Dota 2** (Rubick main, of course) or the epic adventures of **The Witcher** and **Red Dead Redemption**, gaming fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills.

## 🏀 From the Court to the Console

🏀 **Basketball and gaming have a lot in common** 🕹️:
- Strategy 🏀 ➝ Map awareness 🎮
- Teamwork 🤝 ➝ Cooperative gameplay 🕹️
- Precision 🎯 ➝ Frame-perfect execution 🔥

Basketball used to be my go-to adrenaline rush, but now I channel that energy into competitive gaming and crafting digital experiences. Turns out, strategy and teamwork are just as important in both worlds!

## 💻 Computing My Way to the Future

Currently pursuing my **Master of Computing**, I'm on a quest to dive deep into game development and software engineering. My ultimate goal? To turn my passion for gaming into something players around the world can enjoy.
