# About Me

## Hey there! I'm Xing Chen 🌟

Greetings, traveler of the internet! I'm Xing Chen, a gaming enthusiast, basketball lover (though my post-eye-surgery days keep me off the court), and a tech geek navigating the world of computing. 🚀

## 🎮 Gamer by Heart, Coder by Trade
When I'm not immersed in writing code, I'm usually deep in the world of video games. Whether it's the strategic chaos of **Dota 2** (Rubick main, of course) or the epic adventures of **The Witcher** and **Red Dead Redemption**, gaming fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills.

## 🏀 From the Court to the Console
Basketball used to be my go-to adrenaline rush, but now I channel that energy into competitive gaming and crafting digital experiences. Turns out, strategy and teamwork are just as important in both worlds!

## 💻 Computing My Way to the Future
Currently pursuing my **Master of Computing**, I'm on a quest to dive deep into game development and software engineering. My ultimate goal? To turn my passion for gaming into something players around the world can enjoy.

## 🎯 The Dream
I aspire to work in the gaming industry, shaping the next generation of interactive experiences. Whether it's through coding, design, or problem-solving, I want to leave my mark in the virtual world.

Let's connect and talk about games, tech, or anything in between! 🚀
